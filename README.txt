# DP-based Pairwise Sequence Alignment Algorithms

Algorithms:

- [X] Global: Needleman-Wunsh
- [X] Local: Smith-Waterman
- [X] Semi-global ("Glocal"): adapted Smith-Waterman

To do:

- [ ] Optimise path finding with Hirschberg
- [ ] File parsing for input files
- [ ] Add input arguments and help
- [ ] Make JAR executable
